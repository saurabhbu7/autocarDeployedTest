      2024 (MMXXIV) is the current year, and is a leap year starting on
Monday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2024th year of the Common Era (CE)
and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 24th year of
the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the 5th year of
the 2020s decade. So far, this year has witnessed the continuation of major armed conflicts,
including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Myanmar civil war, the war in
Sudan, and the Islamist insurgency in the Sahel. The continuation of
the Israel–Hamas war has further caused spillover into many countries,
including a crisis in the Red Sea impacting global shipping. Approximately 79 countries, representing around four billion people, are
expected to conduct national elections throughout the course of the
year,[1][2][3][4] including eight out of ten of the world's most populous
countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, India, Mexico, Indonesia, and
the United States).[1] The European Parliament will also hold elections.[5]
